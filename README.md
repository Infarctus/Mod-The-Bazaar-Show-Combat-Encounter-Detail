# Show Combat Encounter Detail
This mod shows combat encounter information when hovering them :
- Health
- Skills
- Items & item description  

## Mod has been moved to the [BazaarTracker](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Sebastien_Tromp-BazaarTracker) ï»¿and will be updated there. This github is no longer maintained


The mod is still a work in progress I've spent a lot of hours on this.(the information has not been updated to latest patch)  
This mod is based on [`The Bazaar: Cheat Sheet`](https://jade-dead-e8e.notion.site/The-Bazaar-Cheat-Sheet-13531ff9bda580e19a10c96bb6d9e346#13831ff9bda580a4b8e3d1da20ab4576)

## Install
- ### Mod loader (not needed if you already installed the tracker unless you were using a previous version of this mod then uninstall BepInEx and do the steps)
  If you never launched/did an update/reinstalled the game, launch it at least once before continuing (just get to the main menu that's all)  

  Download [The latest version of BepInEx 5](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v5.4.23.2/BepInEx_win_x64_5.4.23.2.zip)  

  Extract in the games root folder (usually `C:\Program Files\Tempo Launcher - Beta\The Bazaar game_64\bazaarwinprodlatest`)  

- ### Mod Install
  Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Infarcactus/Mod-The-Bazaar-Show-Combat-Encounter-Detail/releases) (not the source code)  
  Extract it in `BepInEx\plugins` (in your game files)  

  If you did everything properly in `<your game install>\BepInEx\plugins` you should see a folder named `ShowCombatEncounterDetail`  
  
  **If the toolips do not show after installation**, in `<your game install>\BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg`, set `HideManagerGameObject = true` (it should be near the top)

## Uninstall
- Go to your game folder and `BepInEx\plugins`
- Delete `ShowCombatEncounterDetail` folder
